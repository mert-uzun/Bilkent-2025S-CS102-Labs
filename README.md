# Bilkent 2025S CS102 Lab Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the lab assignments for CS102: Algorithms and Programming II, taken during the Spring 2025 semester at Bilkent University.

## Catalog Description
Enhanced Object-Oriented Programming with Java. Inheritance and polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces, graphical-user-interfaces, exceptions. 
Abstract data structures: lists, stacks, queues and trees. Recursion. Files. Searching and sorting. Hashing. Time and space considerations. 
Students undertake a large design project involving teamwork, independent learning, writing and presenting of requirements, user-interface design, and project documentation.

## Repository Structure
Each folder corresponds to a different lab assignment, named and organized by lab number (e.g., `Lab01`, `Lab02`, etc.).

## Disclaimer
These solutions are intended for educational purposes only. If you're a current or future student of CS101, please do not copy or submit this code as your own â€” academic integrity is important.
